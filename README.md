# ‚ú®**THE STTP-PROTOCOL-SUITE**‚ú®


The **STTP-Protocol-Suite** is a collection of experimental Layer 2 protocols that transmit UTF-8 text directly over raw Ethernet. No IP. No TCP. No ports. Just frames. STTP stands for Simple Text Transfer Protocol.

Originally developed as a learning project, this suite explores how real data travels across networks at the lowest level, and how to build a functioning protocol from scratch ‚Äì from raw bytes to encryption and reliability.

It's **not** really a serious Project, just a bit fooling around with Frames. Most is written by Ai because i don't code Professionally. I configure Networks and stuff, so I don't have much expirence with Python.

I made this dumpsterfire in 11 Days so don't expect it to be good...

I made this in Juli 2025, I am in my first year of Vocational Training. I only have one year of experience in IT.

So please don't flame me for this dumpsterfire that I call codeüò≠

**NOTHING HERE IS PROFESSIONAL!!**

## Scripts

There are always three scripts. A sender, a receiver and a chatter who can do both.

## üì¶ Included Protocols

| Protocol | Encryption | Features |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **STTP**    | ‚ùå        | Minimalistic text over raw Ethernet |
| **STTPS**   | ‚úÖ AES + RSA | Secure peer-to-peer messaging |
| **ESTTPS**  | ‚úÖ AES + RSA | Sessions, reliability, flags, CRC |

## üîπ STTP ‚Äî *Simple Text Transfer Protocol*

> "No headers, no checks, just vibes."

STTP is a barebones Ethernet protocol built for pure learning purposes.

### Features
- Operates entirely on **Layer 2 (Ethernet)** using EtherType '0x88B5'
- Uses raw sockets in Python to send and receive frames
- UTF-8 payload inserted directly into the Ethernet payload
- Sender manually builds Ethernet frames (MAC + EtherType + Payload)
- Receiver filters by EtherType and displays decoded message
- No fragmentation, no encryption, no connection logic ‚Äì it‚Äôs truly "dumb simple"

### Use Case
STTP is perfect for:
- Learning how Ethernet frames work
- Understanding raw socket communication
- Experimenting with protocol design at the byte level


---


## üîπ STTPS ‚Äî *Secure Text Transfer Protocol (Secure)*

> "Like STTP ‚Äì but secret."

STTPS builds upon STTP by introducing asymmetric encryption with a hybrid **RSA + AES** model.

### Key Features
- AES-256 for message encryption
- RSA-2048 for session key exchange
- Still Layer 2 (no IP stack)
- Simple 1-byte header to define the message type

### Message Types
| Code | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `0x01` | REQ  | Request public RSA key |
| `0x02` | KEY  | Send public RSA key |
| `0x03` | AES  | Send AES session key (encrypted) |
| `0x05` | ACK  | Confirm successful AES key reception |
| `0x04` | MES  | Encrypted message (AES-256-CBC) |
| `0x07` | PLA  | Plaintext message (for debugging / chaos) |

### Key Exchange Flow

REQ -> KEY -> AES -> ACK


### Notes
- Re-keying happens automatically after 10 encrypted messages
- Still uses EtherType `0x88B5`
- All payloads are manually padded to fulfill Ethernet‚Äôs minimum frame size
- STTPS does **NOT** provide Integrity and Authenticity.

## üîπ ESTTPS ‚Äî *Extended Secure Text Transfer Protocol Secure*

> "Yes. It has sessions. And flags. And fragmentation. And probably alot of bugs."

ESTTPS is a fully-featured evolution of STTPS. It introduces **sessions, reliable transmission, fragmentation**, and **custom protocol headers** ‚Äì all still at Layer 2.

### Protocol Design
Each ESTTPS frame contains:
- **8-byte protocol header**: `Type, Flags, Session-ID, Length, CRC16`
- **20-byte username** (padded UTF-8)
- **Payload** (variable length)

### Header Fields
| Field | Size | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `Type` | 1 byte | Defines the kind of packet (REQ, KEY, MES, etc.) |
| `Flags` | 1 byte | Bit flags for features (ENC, REL, FRAG, FIN...) |
| `Session ID` | 2 bytes | Identifies the session |
| `Length` | 2 bytes | Total length of Username + Payload |
| `CRC16` | 2 bytes | Header checksum (CCITT-FALSE) |

### Flags (Bitmask)
| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `ENC` | Payload is AES-encrypted |
| `FRAG` | Fragmented packet |
| `LAST` | Last fragment of message |
| `SYN` | Session setup request |
| `ACK` | Acknowledgment |
| `FIN` | End session |
| `ERR` | Protocol error |
| `REL` | Reliable delivery (requires ACK) |

### Features
- Supports **broadcast mode** and **direct messages (DM)**
- **AES + RSA** key exchange as in STTPS
- **Reliable delivery** with retransmissions and ACKs
- **Session handling** (start, accept, close)
- **Fragmentation and reassembly**
- **Verbose debugging & CLI interface**
- **Fully terminal-controlled (no GUI required)**

## üîß How to Start

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Requirements
- Linux system (due to raw socket requirements)
- Python 3.10 or newer
- `cryptography` module:
  ```bash
  pip install cryptography
  ```
Run it with root privileges!

```bash
sudo python3 your_script.py
```


---


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ö†Ô∏è Hardcoded Configuration

Many scripts (like `sttp-reciver.py`, `sttps-chatter.py`, `sttps_sender.py`, etc.) contain **hardcoded values** that **must be changed** before use:

| Setting     | Description                            | Example                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `INTERFACE` | Name of your network interface         | `"eth0"` or `"enp3s0"` |
| `SRC_MAC`   | Spoofed source MAC address             | `"de:ad:be:ef:00:02"`  |
| `DEST_MAC`  | Destination MAC address (optional)     | `"ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff"`  | 

> You **must** adjust these to match your system or you‚Äôll get socket binding errors.


---


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Recommended: Use `chatter_esttps.py`

The **ESTTPS Chatter** script allows **command-line arguments** to avoid hardcoding:

```bash
sudo python3 chatter_esttps.py -i eth0 -m de:ad:be:ef:00:01 -n <username>
```

| Option | Purpose                      |
| ------ | ---------------------------- |
| `-i`   | Interface name               |
| `-m`   | Source MAC address (spoofed) |
| `-n`   | Username (max. 20 bytes)     |
| `-v`   | *(optional)* Verbose mode    |

Once started, use `!help` to list all commands.


---


### 4Ô∏è‚É£ First Test Setup (STTP or STTPS)

1. Run `reciver.py` or `sttps_receiver.py` on one machine.
2. Run the matching sender script on the other.
3. Ensure both machines use matching EtherType and interface.
4. STTP messages should appear directly; STTPS messages require key exchange.


---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Tip for Testing

* Use tools like `ip link` or `ifconfig` to find interface names
* Disable firewalls if frames are being dropped

## üõë Maintainer Disclaimer

> *‚ÄúWill this repo be actively maintained?‚Äù*  
> Short answer: **fuck no**üò≠  

This project started as a personal learning sandbox. Once the initial curiosity fades there is a **high chance I‚Äôll forget it exists and move on to the next shiny protocol idea**.  
Consequences:

| Item | Reality Check |
|------|---------------|
| **Merge / Pull Requests** | Might sit in limbo for ages. Don‚Äôt take it personally. |
| **Issue Tracker** | Used mostly as a TODO pad for myself. Response times can vary from minutes to never. |
| **Feature Requests** | Cool ideas, but unless they align with my own nerd-itch they may never land. |

**What you can do instead**  
- Fork the repo and hack away.  Do what you want! I dont care if you don't name me or even sell itüíÄ
- Tag me if you publish something cool;  I'll notice.  (You can E-mail me or add me on Discord. User: Lauchpaul)
- Treat the code as a reference / inspiration rather than a polished product.

In short: use at your own risk, contribute if you like, but **don't expect anything** regarding maintainer responsiveness.

## ‚ú® Anything else?

- The code has Comments, but don't expect good documentation. For STTPS and STTPS use the !help command in the Chatter programm.
- Like I said, the code isn't 100% bug free, i would recommend using two old Laptops.
- The scripts were testet only in Debian. I'm not 100% sure if this works on other Distros.
- If you any questions, send me an E-mail or Discord... User: Lauchpaul
